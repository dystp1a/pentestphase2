MISC 1


On running the strings command as the title suggests, we get a base 64 encoded string which links to a txt file.

MISC 3

On a search, we get that it's a wingdings encoded string. On decoding with <https://www.dcode.fr/wingdings-font> we get f︎l︎a︎g︎{︎7︎2︎1︎2︎3︎d︎c︎e︎a︎1︎9︎9︎3︎6︎5︎3︎3︎e︎4︎5︎2︎5︎a︎2︎e︎1︎5︎b︎a︎d︎5︎c︎}︎

MISC 4

It is a multiple times encoded base64 file, on decoding with python

\```python 

import base64

flag = open("msg.txt", 'r').read()

for x in range(50):

`    `try:

`        `flag = base64.b64decode(flag).decode('utf-8')

`    `except:

`        `print(flag)

`        `break 

\```

We get a python code and on reversing the code we get the flag

MISC 5

We see that on decoding from hex we get a cryptic string, on mapping each word on the keyboard we see that it encloses a letter which comes out to be ctfpstxhaksoqlh
